# NoC_Project

to run the project need to use the following 

vsim -L altera_ver -L lpm_ver -L sgate_ver -L altera_mf_ver -L altera_lnsim_ver -L cyclone10gx_ver -suppress 14408 -suppress 16154 work.mvm1_tb 


-- this needs to be cleaned up, right now we can get a sim running but it is not at all functional
