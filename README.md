# NoC_Project

to run a sim do the following in order: 

```
cp .aliases ~/
source ~/.bashrc
cd sim
source simg.tcl
```

> Note: sourcing the bashrc will set up aliases, without these set up the scripts to run the simulation will not work. The .aliases file may need to be updated if using different servers.
